Expected value 
========= 
For Snippet1, we hope to have `google.com because this link is the only one in right form. 
For Snippet2, we hope to have a.com(()) because this link is the only one in right form. 
For Snippet3, we hope to have https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/cse-15l-spring-2022/schedule.

test
========= 
Snippet1 
![Image](https://github.com/MinilordKREE/-cse15l-lab-reports/blob/main/test%20results.png)  
Our test failed because we couldn't find the correct connection. The existence of "`" requires us to add an additional search condition. When we find it, continue the progress.
Snippet2

I think in this case we need to add an additional while loop and if condition to make the opening parenthesis match the closing parenthesis to get the correct link.
Snippet3

In this case, we need to add some if conditions to determine the existence of a new line. And the relationship between spaces and parentheses also needs to be judged.
